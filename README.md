# Birds_CNN_PyTorch
Learning project for school. </br>
Idea is to present your work in detail to other students in the course. 

## CNN Architecture
Still undecided

## Data
High quality birds dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species/data
* 525 bird species
* 84635 training img
  * Each species has at least 130 training imgs
  * ~80% Male and 20% female, this is a shortcoming in the dataset   
* 2625 test & validation imgs (~3% each, very low IMO)
* 224x224x3 JPG

## Approach
Data is prepared, we can go almost straight into modeling and evaluation. </br>
Plan is to make a nice well explained Jupyter Notebook that can be presented live (except the training of course) </br>
* Save the model
* Explain everything
* Visualizations

Note: Again, this is a learning project. Never coded PyTorch myself before.
